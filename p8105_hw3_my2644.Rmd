## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp= .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal()+theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)


```
###problem 1
```{r}
data("instacart")
```
This dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user/order variables -- user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There are also item variables -- name, aisle, department, and some numeric codes.

1. How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count (aisle) %>% 
  arrange (desc(n)) 
```
2. Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count (aisle) %>% 
  filter (n>10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + geom_point() + theme(axis.text = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

3. Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  filter (aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
      filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange (aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


4. Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  filter (product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour= mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
  
```
###Problem 2

1. Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should include all originally observed variables and values; have useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

```{r}
accel_df=read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>%
 
pivot_longer(activity_1:activity_1440,
             names_to = "min_of_day",
             names_prefix = "activity_",
             values_to = "activity_count") %>% 
  
  mutate(
         day=as.factor(day),
         activity_count=as.numeric(activity_count),
  min_of_day=as.numeric(min_of_day),
  day_id=as.numeric(day_id),
  week=as.numeric(week)
  ) %>% 
  
  
  mutate(weekdays_vs_weekend = case_when(
           day  %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "Weekdays",
          day  %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "Weekend")) %>% 

 knitr::kable()
```
The dataframe accel_df contains `r nrow(accel_df)` observations and `r ncol(accel_df)` columns. Variables include week, day_id, day, min_of_day, activity_count, and weekdays_vs_weekend.

Aggregate accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals.
